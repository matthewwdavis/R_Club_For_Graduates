## Chapter 2: Names and Values

Quiz
1. Given the following data frame, how do I create a new column called “3” that contains the sum of `1` and `2`? You may only use `$`, not `[[`. What makes `1`, `2`, and `3` challenging as variable names?

```{r}
# Dataframe
df <- data.frame(runif(3), runif(3))
names(df) <- c(1, 2)
df

# Solution
df %>%
  mutate(`3` = `1`+`2`)
```

2. In the following code, how much memory does `y` occupy?
```{r}
x <- runif(1e6)
y <- list(x, x, x) # 8Mb
```

3. On which line does `a` get copied in the following example?
```{r}
a <- c(1, 5, 3, 2)
b <- a
b[[1]] <- 10
b
# on the first line
```

Acccessing an objects identifiers
```{r}
obj_addr(df)
obj_addr(y)
```

Identifiers change every time R is restarted

When creating names, use backticks instead of " or ' for consistency of naming context

__2.2.2 Exercises__

1. Explain the relationship between a, b, c and d in the following code:
```{r}
a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10
```
 a is b and c. d contains the same values, but was created without association with a, b, and c

2. The following code accesses the mean function in multiple ways. Do they all point to the same underlying function object? Verify this with `lobstr::obj_addr()`.

```{r}
mean
base::mean
get("mean")
evalq(mean)
match.fun("mean")
```
In Markdown, the addresses are told to you, so it seems you don't need `obj_addr()` to confirm the object id

3. By default, base R data import functions, like `read.csv()`, will automatically convert non-syntactic names to syntactic ones. Why might this be problematic? What option allows you to suppress this behaviour?
```{r}
?read.csv
# Use `check.names = FALSE`
```
Changing the names could create uncertainty in what is being displayed

4. What rules does `make.names()` use to convert non-syntactic names into syntactic ones?
`make.names(names, unique = FALSE, allow_ = TRUE)`

5. I slightly simplified the rules that govern syntactic names. Why is `.123e1` not a syntactic name? Read `?make.names` for the full details
It could be due to invalid characters being converted to `.`

See when an object gets coppied with `tracemem()`

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
cat(tracemem(x), "\n")

#From here on, whenever that object is copied, `tracemem()` will print a message telling you which object was copied, its new address, and the sequence of calls that led to the copy:

y <- x
y[[3]] <- 4

# `untracemem()` turns tracing off
untracemem(x)
```

R uses refrences with character vectors
```{r}
x <- c("a", "a", "abc", "d")

# `ref()` shows the references r uses when `character = TRUE`

ref(x, character = TRUE)

```

2.3.6 Exercises
1. Why is `tracemem(1:10)` not useful?
```{r}
tracemem(1:10)
```
There was no object created, so the ID is not going to be consistent.

2. Explain why `tracemem()` shows two copies when you run this code. Hint: carefully look at the difference between this code and the code shown earlier in the section
```{r}
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
tracemem(x)

x[[3]] <- 4
```
Because the new value is non-syntactic. Is it being saved as two classes?

3. Sketch out the relationship between the following objects:
```{r}
a <- 1:10

tracemem(a)

b <- list(a, a)

tracemem(b)

c <- list(b, a, 1:10)

tracemem(c)
```


4. What happens when you run this code?
```{r}
x <- list(1:10)
x[[2]] <- x
x
```


2.4.1 Exercises

1. In the following example, why are `object.size(y)` and `obj_size(y)` so radically different? Consult the documentation of `object.size()`
```{r}
y <- rep(list(runif(1e4)), 100)

object.size(y)

obj_size(y)

?object.size
```
`obj_size` is reporting in kB, `object.size` is reporting in B

2. Take the following list. Why is its size somewhat misleading?
```{r}
funs <- list(mean, sd, var)
obj_size(funs)
obj_size(funs[[1]])
obj_size(funs[[2]])
obj_size(funs[[3]])
```
It is a list of three functions and tells you the total size, not the size of each function. These are also base R functions, so they are already loaded on boot

3. Predict the output of the following code:
```{r}
a <- runif(1e6)
obj_size(a)

b <- list(a, a)
obj_size(b)
obj_size(a, b)

b[[1]][[1]] <- 10
obj_size(b)
obj_size(a, b)

b[[2]][[1]] <- 10
obj_size(b)
obj_size(a, b)
```

2.5.3 Exercises

1. Explain why the following code doesn’t create a circular list.
```{r}
x <- list()
x[[1]] <- x
```
Because the list originally contained nothing

2. Wrap the two methods for subtracting medians into two functions, then use the ‘bench’ package to carefully compare their speeds. How does performance change as the number of columns increase?
```{r}

```

3. What happens if you attempt to use `tracemem()` on an environment?
Environments are always modified in place
